AETHER – CONTROL NODE: 

Haswell CPU (or newer), with at least 4 CPU cores and 16GB RAM.
    • Clean install of Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 Server ISO(or later) kernel.
For example, something like an Intel N100 is likely more than enough to get started.

Pre-requestie:

     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade 
     sudo apt install net-tools 
     sudo apt install iptables-persistent
     sudo apt install netplan.io
 
Check whether the firewall is disable :

     sudo systemctl status ufw.service 
     sudo systemctl stop ufw.service 
     sudo systemctl disable ufw.service 
  
Check whether the network service is enabled:
 
     systemctl status systemd-networkd.service

Removing python3 and Installing python 3.8 v-env:
 
     sudo apt autoremove python3.10
     python3 –version

Installing Pipx and Python 3.8 - venv :

     sudo apt install pipx
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install ubuntu-advantage-tools
     sudo apt install software-properties-common
     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
     sudo apt install python3.8-venv

Note that Aether assumes Ubuntu Server (as opposed to Ubuntu Desktop), the main implication being that it uses systemd-networkd rather than Network Manager to manage network settings. It is possible to work around this requirement, but be aware that doing so may impact the Ansible playbook for installing SD-Core.
OnRamp depends on Ansible, which you can install on your server as follows:

$ pipx install --include-deps ansible
$ pipx ensurepath
$ sudo apt-get install sshpass
$ sudo apt install ansible

Once installed, displaying the Ansible version number should result in output similar to the following:

$ ansible --version
$ ansible-galaxy collection install kubernetes.core

Note that a fresh install of Ubuntu may be missing other packages that you need (e.g., git, curl, make), but you will be prompted to install them as you step through the Quick Start sequence.
